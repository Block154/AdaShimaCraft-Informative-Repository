Some Notes:
  Where you spawn when you log in will be visible to others! Why? The sharing of start acces gives the logs as well (I can't do it without). Don't worry, your IP Address is hidden!

**R U L E S:**
  1. Use common logic.
  2. Don't make use of hack-type stuff.
  3. Preferably don't make a base further than 7000 blocks from spawn.
